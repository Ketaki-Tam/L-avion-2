# L-avion
A website that helps users book flights online .User need to enter their depature place , destination and date of travel, make the payment and their booking will be done.


# How to run the code
1) install npm
2) intall react
3) go the folder containg the src,public folders in  the terminal.
4) type ```npm run build``` followed by ```npm start```.
5) the website will load in the default browser of the user.
6) the website is user friendly ,so browse through and enjoy.



# Basic Structure
1) Once you go to the above mentioned terminal you will find four main folders namely build,node_modules,public,src along with three other files namely package.json,package-lock.json,README.md.
2) The build folder represents the path to the final production build.This folder will be created after the ```npm run build``` command.
3) The node_modules is the repository of modules which are used inside the project.
4) Public folder contains static files such as index.html and javascript library files,images etc which we dont want to be processed by the webpack.
5) Src folder contains all the .js and .css files that are used in developing  the webpage.

# URL Paths:
1) The first page that loads is the home page(mainpage.js) which contains the login(login.js), signup(signup.js) and the about us page(about_us.js).
2) There is also option for searching and booking flights(BLR_MAA.js) for guest users.
3) The about us page contains the details about us(L'avion).
4) The signin and login pages requires the users to give corresponding inputs which will then eventually lead them to home page.
5) Clicking the book option on the booking page will take you to the payment gateway which will then take you to the confirmation page upon succesfull payment.

# Our Struggles 
1) Didnot know HTML and CSS,learnt it within a span of 3 days.
2) had problems in downloading npm and react.
3) had problems in linking bootstrap and react.
4) we did find a few solutions online and that helped us overcome these difficulties.
